## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### 1. Web Interface:
```
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5000
2. Click "Create Your Design"
3. Fill in project parameters
4. Select enhanced blueprint options
5. Generate and download results
```

### 2. Direct API Usage:
```python
from architectural_engine import ArchitecturalDesigner
from visualization.cad_renderer import CADRenderer

# Initialize components
designer = ArchitecturalDesigner()
renderer = CADRenderer()

design = designer.generate_design(input_params)
floor_plans = designer.generate_all_floor_plans(design)

# Render professional blueprints
for floor_plan in floor_plans:
    blueprint = renderer.render_floor_plan(
        floor_plan,
        show_dimensions=True,
        show_grid=True
    )
```

### 3. Demo Script:
